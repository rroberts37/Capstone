Thank you for parchusing the Sakari games supermarket interior Pack!
Within this pack you will find a range of Assets that created the environments of Trailer Trashers.

In this pack you will find props from:
* a supermarket interior


All the assets are low poly and optimised for low end devices.
For the most optimal batchcount the assets share materials that range from handpainted textures to colorpalettes.
Be sure to check out the material that corrosponds with the asset.

For the best use all props have been made into prefabs and have been given simple colliders, you can alter them for your own purpose if needed.

In this pack you also find a skybox shader and a post processing stack that can be applied.
